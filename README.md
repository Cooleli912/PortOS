# Info
PortOS is a non-profit project made to bring devices with basically nothing in them to being your very own handmade tablet without a touchscreen. but hey it has a gyroscope, and a useless SD card slot...

# Installation
alright, so this project is supported by a few devices, actually all of them that are supported on https://arcade.makecode.com and no others, I'll be using the Meowbit as it is the only one I have.

First things first, download the repository, then unzip it, then put the .uf2 file in a folder like your downloads, or your documents. plug your device into your computer using the USB cable that came with it, on the Meowbit, simply press the top orange button on the side of the Meowbit, this will bring you to upload mode. Remember that .uf2 file you got, well if a white box appears when you plug in your device, choose file explorer, then drag and drop the .uf2 file into the root of the drive, and boom! you have added PortOS for your device!

# Updating
Just plug it in, go to upload mode, then download the latest release from this github page, then put the .uf2 onto the drive.

# Features
A silky smooth user interface that can easily let you reach your destinations, and always runs at 60 FPS.
It currently has 2 games and 2 tools, you can play a version of Rock Up Points, which was one of my old games, play a nice game of tag that's insanely hard, beat my high score of 45, I dare you :), or Rename your account, or check out your Console Info.
